# Clinical Quality Language (CQL) Support in Visual Studio Code

Adds syntax highlighting to CQL files in VSCode. Adapted from the [atom_cql_support](https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support) package for Atom.

## How to Install
1. If you don't have Visual Studio Code, [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.
2. Clone or copy this repository into your Visual Studio Code extensions folder (see https://vscode-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/install-extension/ for help on finding where this is located on your machine).
3. From Visual Studio Code, check the available extensions. Enable the `cql-language` extension.

## Using the CQL support extension in VSCode

After you've installed the _cql-language_ extension, open any _.cql_ file in VSCode. As long as the file has the _.cql_ extension, syntax highlighting will be automatically applied.

**NOTE: Syntax highlighting makes editing and reviewing CQL files easier, but does _not_ validate the technical or syntactic validity of the CQL statements. This package does not flag invalid CQL.**
