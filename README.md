# Clinical Quality Language (CQL) Support in Visual Studio Code

Adds syntax highlighting to CQL files in VSCode. Adapted from the [atom_cql_support](https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support) package for Atom.

## How to Install

The [cql-language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=athenahealth.cql-language) extension has been published to the VSCode extension repository, so installation is simple:

1. If you don't have Visual Studio Code, [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.
2. Install the _cql-language_ extension by follow the instructions for [installing extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).

## Using the CQL support extension in VSCode

After you've installed the _cql-language_ extension, open any _.cql_ file in VSCode. As long as the file has the _.cql_ extension, syntax highlighting will be automatically applied.

**NOTE: Syntax highlighting makes editing and reviewing CQL files easier, but does _not_ validate the technical or syntactic validity of the CQL statements. This package does not flag invalid CQL.**
